# Going beyond the test pyramid: Achieving strong code correctness

This repository contains the code samples and examples discussed in the talk "Going beyond the test pyramid: Achieving strong code correctness." The talk explores property-based testing with fast-check, model checking with Alloy, and an overview of the "refinement types" proposal (Panagiotis Vekris et al. Refinement Types for TypeScript).

## Contents

- `property-based-testing/`: Code samples showcasing property-based testing using the fast-check library. These examples demonstrate how to write property-based tests that generate a wide range of test cases and verify the correctness of the code based on properties and invariants.

- `model-checking/`: Code samples demonstrating the use of Alloy for model checking. These examples show how to define models and specifications using Alloy and perform analysis to identify potential issues and ensure code correctness.

- `refinement-types/`: Notes on the "refinement types" proposal and how it can enhance code correctness in TypeScript.
